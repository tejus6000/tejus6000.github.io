									<h2>Introduction</h2>								
								</header>
								<p>In this section we shall go through some supervised machine learning models and see how they work. We shall use data from the game EA FIFA. FIFA is a football simulator game which is played by many people around the world. The game gives all the players a rating and scores in a variety of categories. These stats are gathered by studying the players performance on the pitch by many experts.   </p>
								<p>These stats can't be proven as 100% accurate but have some credibility to them. In fact they can be considered as the most credible source of stats for the players. Using these stats we shall try to classify the players into their suitable positions on the pitch. We will also see how the stats vary to different players based on their position.</p>
								<p>We will also take a look at a dataset which contains information of the matches between all the teams in the premier league 2020-2021 season. We can check the different factors like home games, away games, possesion, shot attempts, etc and if they affect the result of the match. We will train our models on 30 matchweek games and then try to predict the results for the remaining 8 weeks. This will be interesting because predicting the result of a football match is very difficult. Even with various match facts it will be tough to predict, because football is a game where the unpredictable outcomes take place very often.</p>
