								<p>There are many major leagues which are quite popular in the countries of europe like, english premier league (england), Bundesliga (germany), La Liga (Spain) ... so on with many professional players participating in it. Each team also has an organization behind it which manages the players, their salaries, performs trades with other teams, and scouts for new and young players.</br>The goal of this analyses is to analyze the stats of all professional players playing the game and check out which players had an amazing season last year. We will probably see many famous name on the list like Christiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Robert Lewandoski,etc. who have a consistent solid performance every year. But, there will also be other wonder kids or less known players who had a great year. Our goal is to cluster the players based on goals per assists to cluster them into different groups. We must be careful because a 1:1 ratio is good but a player with 5 goals / 5 assists and player with 15 goals / 15 assists will both have 1:1 ratio. But cleary the second player had a much better season. We will go through more on this in the analysis section.</br>This information can be usefull for manager and scouting team. They might want a player who can score all the time or a player who can set up a goal for his teammates or a player who is good in both departments and has great potential.  </p>
								<p>We will be using the tweets that we gathered from the Twitter API to perform association rule mining. For this, tweets from a specific user handle was used so that we dont get any duplicate tweets from retweets. The tweets that will be used here are tweets from @ESPNUK which is a news coverage page of the sports happening in the UK. Most of the tweets that we will be getting will be related to football as it is the most popular sport over there. In this way we will get a wide range of information on different players, teams, managers,etc. Once we perform the analysis we can see the most trending topics related to sports in the UK.</p>
